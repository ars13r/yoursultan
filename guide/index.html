    <header><h1>Life in Washington DC</h1></header>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gJQ3WVMd/DC1.webp">
    <div class="container">
	<p> For prototype, only Georgetown works</p>
	<div id="map"></div>
</div>
<p>Washington, DC, is a city defined by power, history, and diversity. Living in the nation's capital means navigating an urban environment where politics meets culture, surrounded by iconic landmarks and a strong sense of community. Here's what to know if you're considering calling DC home.</p>

    <hr>
	<h2>Neighborhoods with Character</h2>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/rwXRgyHn/DC3.jpg">
    <p>DC's neighborhoods each have a unique identity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Georgetown:</strong> Known for its historic buildings and waterfront, Georgetown is a mix of upscale shops, restaurants, and university life. The area maintains its old-world charm while catering to those seeking both a social scene and scenic walks. During tourist seasons, Georgetown can become busier than any other neighborhood.</li>
        <li><strong>Dupont Circle:</strong> A hub for young professionals and diplomats, this neighborhood is lively, with bookshops, art galleries, and cafes. But it is not just for the intelectuals, as it is also the home to the undergrad bar scene.</li>
        <li><strong>Capitol Hill:</strong> Home to congressional staffers and young families, this area blends classic architecture and local markets with proximity to the National Mall.</li>
        <li><strong>Mt. Pleasant:</strong> Consistently named one of the coolest neighborhoods in DC, it offers a vibrant community, tree-lined streets, and easy access to the city's attractions while maintaining a charming, small-town feel.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaw:</strong> Historically significant for its African American roots, especially in music and culture, this area is now a mix of long-time residents, trendy new establishments, and some of the city's best nightlife.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarendon, Arlington:</strong> Seamlessly blending big city amenities and suburban community feel, attracting young professionals, families, and retirees with its prime location, robust job market, and high quality of life.</li>
        <li><strong>Old Town, Alexandria:</strong> Just across the Potomac from DC, historic Alexandria provides residents a charming alternative to the capital's bustle, with its cobblestone streets, 18th century architecture, vibrant Old Town, and scenic waterfront.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Green Spaces and Outdoor Activities</h2>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/vH66Wx0x/dc2.jpg">
    <p>Despite its urban core, DC is rich in parks and outdoor activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rock Creek Park:</strong> A massive urban park perfect for hiking, biking, and outdoor sports. It provides a reprieve from city life with its winding trails and quiet groves.</li>
        <li><strong>The National Mall:</strong> More than a tourist hotspot, it's used by locals for running, playing sports, or simply enjoying a walk among monuments and memorials. During spring and summer, The Mall will be filled with picnics, softball games, and festivals.</li>
        <li><strong>The Riverfronts:</strong> Both the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers have miles of pedestrian trails and offer kayaking, paddleboarding, and riverside picnicking. The Riverfronts also include more rustic hiking and fishing areas as you travel further north.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>A Diverse Food Scene</h2>
    <p>DC's dining options reflect its multicultural population:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Specialties:</strong> Don't miss the city's signature half-smoke, a spiced sausage served at places like Ben's Chili Bowl. A walk home from the bar is best done with a Jumbo Slice of pizza that is bigger than your head and in DC, be sure to order your fried chicken with mambo sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>International Cuisine:</strong> Ethiopian food is especially popular due to DC's significant Ethiopian community. Adams Morgan and U Street offer some of the best options, but these nondescript restaurants, like Cher Cher are all over town.</li>
        <li><strong>High-End Dining:</strong> With several Michelin-starred restaurants, DC caters to those looking for refined dining experiences. Minibar by José Andrés showcases innovative dishes that are as intriguing as they are delicious.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Arts, Culture, and Museums</h2>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/nLV4Ycj8/dc4.gif">
    <p>Living in DC means easy access to world-class museums and cultural institutions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Smithsonian Museums:</strong> A highlight of DC living, from the National Museum of Natural History to the National Portrait Gallery. The best part? They're free.</li>
        <li><strong>The Kennedy Center:</strong> Hosts everything from operas and orchestras to modern theater and concerts.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Art and Music:</strong> Shaw and H Street are known for live music venues, showcasing everything from jazz and rock to emerging indie bands. Check out The Anthem, Madams Organ, or The Atlantis for intimate concerts.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Getting Around</h2>
    <p>Navigating DC is easy for walkers but can be hard for others:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Transit:</strong> The Metro system is clean and well laid out for a city of DC's size. Service hours are limited and unexpected delays can be an issue. Buses fill in the gaps, connecting neighborhoods the Metro doesn't.</li>
        <li><strong>Biking and Walking:</strong> The city's compact layout makes walking or biking viable options, supported by bike lanes and Capital Bikeshare stations.</li>
        <li><strong>Driving and Traffic:</strong> Parking can be difficult, and traffic is notorious, especially during rush hours and political events. Street closures are common around government buildings and protest sites.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Politics: A Constant Presence</h2>
	<ul class="no-bullets">
    <ul>Politics are woven into the fabric of life in DC. While not everyone works in government or policy, the influence is unavoidable. Protest marches, policy discussions at bars, and an undercurrent of activism shape the city's day-to-day atmosphere. For residents, seeing motorcades or passing by protests becomes routine. Representatives in Congres often have their ego's padded when wonks ask them for pictures at local resturaunts.</ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Annual Events and Celebrations</h2>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/GmF8fwwc/dc5.jpg">
    <p>The city hosts numerous events that engage locals and tourists alike:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cherry Blossom Festival:</strong> Celebrates the city's famous cherry trees each spring, drawing massive (you wouldnt believe) crowds to the Tidal Basin. Locals will often go early on a weekday right after bloom to avoid the crowds.</li>
        <li><strong>Fourth of July:</strong> A grand display of fireworks on the National Mall, coupled with concerts and festivities. Best experienced with a picnic on the Mall before to claim your spot.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h3>Neighborhood Festivals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>H Street Festival:</strong> A massive street fair showcasing music, food, and community.</li>
        <li><strong>Porchfest:</strong> Both Adams Morgan and Petworth host Porchfests where houses hire bands to play on their front porch for anyone to come and listen. Streets are filled with people jamming, enjoying some beverages, and possibly smoking something fragrant.</li>
        <li><strong>DC Pride Parade:</strong> Traveling from U Street to Dupont Circle in June one of the country's largest pride parade is a celebration for the whole city.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarendon Day:</strong> Street festival with live music, food, and local vendors in the Clarendon neighborhood in September.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Day Trips</h2>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/7Zn12TLM/dc6.jpg">
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Shenandoah:</strong> The Blue Ridge Mountains are only one hour away, and Shenandoah National Park and surrounding parks offer fantastic hiking, rock climbing, and caves. Some say that on the top of Old Rag you can see DC on a clear day.</li>
		<li><strong>Baltimore:</strong> A city known a bit more for its grit than DC, Baltimore offers a great change of pace and is easy to get to with the commuter trains. Explore the bustling Inner Harbor waterfront, tour historic Fort McHenry, or catch an Orioles game at Camden Yards.</li>
        <li><strong>Annapolis:</strong> Less than an hour's drive from Washington, DC, the charming city of Annapolis is steeped in American history and maritime tradition. Stroll the brick-lined streets of the historic downtown or enjoy a scenic cruise along the Severn River.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Cost of Living</h2>
	<ul class="no-bullets">
		<li>DC's cost of living is high, especially for housing. Rent and real estate prices vary significantly depending on the neighborhood. Generally, the city is more affordable than other large cities like New York, Boston, and Chicago, but it is still more expensive than the national average.</li>
		<li>Public transit, while reasonably priced, doesn’t cover every corner, so be prepared for supplemental transport costs. Food and drinks are where most budgets go awry, a Bud Light will still cost $5-7 at most bars and a sad desk salad will run you about $12.</li>
	</ul>
    <hr>
	<h2>Climate</h2>
	<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/5jcyPpsY/dc7.jpg">
    <ul class="no-bullets">
	<li>It is unlikely that anyone has moved to DC for the weather. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures often in the 90s, while winters can often fall into the single digits with gusty winds. It is a city that gets all 4 seasons, although spring and fall always seem to come a few weeks later than you hoped.</li>
    <li>Spring and early summer is a fantastic season in DC and comes along with picnics in the sun, boat rides, and rooftop bars. Fall also has gorgeous leaf changes.</p>
	</ul>
<hr>
    <h2>Safety</h2>
   <ul class="no-bullets">
	<li>Like any major city, DC has areas that are safer than others. The city has made significant strides in reducing crime over the years, but awareness and common sense are necessary, particularly at night or in less busy areas.</li>
    <li>Cyclist and pedestrian safety are a priority for the city, but there is still work to be done. Many parts of the city have divided bike lanes and large sidewalks, but some portions do not.</li>
	</ul>
